Avoid duplication
=================

If something is written once and you can easily link to it, use the link.
Duplicate content produces poor search results, confuses the user, and
it can be hard to catch and update all of it.

If users can find two similar yet *slightly* different pieces of content they will 
stop what they are doing and ask for guidance. Worse, what if the user can't decide 
between multiple search results of similar content?

Your organization may have hundreds of file folders on many, many servers. That's a
lot of content needlessly duplicated. Consolidate. Direct
the reader to the right location &mdash; ask someone if you aren't sure.

Before you start writing, check to see it hasn't already been written.
