How to use this guide
=====================

Introduction
------------

I hope you use this guide to create content that is both easy to
understand and serves the reader. There's too much technical documentation 
that just talks *at* the user rather than *with* them. Most
writing leaves user frustrated by information that is doesn't give them what
they came for. Instead of telling them the time, it tells them how to build a clock.

I wanted to address this and offers several common-sense
guidelines about writing for a diverse audience. Using this guide can help you have 
a conversation with your audience. Get to know them and incorporate their
experience and feedback into the process. Always communicate in a
consistent and logical way.


Use this guide as a reference. 

If you have a corporate style guide, use that one. If you don't have a standard, 
take the content here and adapt to your needs. 

Find the topic you're looking for in the table of contents or search by keyword.
Use it the way that makes sense to you.

If you have any suggestions [contact me](mailto:sarrants@gmail.com).

Remember!
------------------------------

Use this guide and adapt it to your group's needs. This is just a
guide. If a section isn't relevant to you and your team, ignore it. If
there is something missing, let me know and I'll add it.
