How to use this guide
=====================

Introduction
------------

This style guide can help you create content that is both easy to
understand and meets people where they are. Documentation often just
talks *at* readers and end-users rather than *to* or *with* them. Most
writing leaves this audience frustrated by information that is neither
actionable nor understandable.

Everything here is intended to spark discussion with you, your team, 
and me! Let me know if you have different opinions and rules. 
Using this guide is the
first step in collaborating with the audience, incorporating their
experience and feedback into the process, and communicating in a
consistent manner.

IÂ structured this guide into descriptively named sections. Find the
topic you're looking for in the table of contents or search by keyword.
Use it the way that makes sense to you.
